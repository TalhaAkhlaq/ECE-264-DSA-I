# Data Structures & Algorithms I

This repository contains projects and coursework related to the Data Structures & Algorithms I course. It focuses on fundamental data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on practical implementation and good programming practices. (**Spring 2024**)

## Course Overview

The course covers:

- **Data Structures**: Lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, algorithm analysis with big-O notation.
- **Programming Methodology**: Practical implementation and good programming practices.

## Project Description and Overview

This repository includes two C++ programs developed for the course:

1. **Program 1**: Calculates and outputs the strength of mysterious creatures called foobars based on their type and position in a line from an input file.
2. **Program 2**: Manages stacks and queues of integers, doubles, and strings by processing commands from an input file and logging operations and errors to an output file.
3. **Program 3**:
